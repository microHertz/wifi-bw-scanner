# WiFi Bandwidth Assessement and Visualization Tool

## Summary
    
The intent of this project is to assess the bandwidth of the Eduroam wifi
network around a select area of the UC Davis campus. A systematic series 
of speed tests will be performed where along with the results, the GPS 
coordinates, and correlated signal strength and quality will be recorded 
as well. Once the data has been gathered, the bandwidth test results and 
signal information will be visualized as a heat map.
